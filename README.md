This tool checks your non-redeemable tokens to identify which ones are eligible for claiming 14-day Nitro trial gifts using old (invalid or valid) linked payment methods.
Tokens marked as Eligible can successfully claim Nitro gifts and act just like receiver tokens — no vcc required.

❌ Tokens shown as Ineligible in this script are not usable for claiming gifts with this method.

🔧 Fast, multi-threaded, proxy-supported checker
